This repo will create a JSON collection of Google Earth Engine apps from my collaborators and those who have shared and publicly made apps available. This is not a complete subset and this list comes from the same users who have publicly shared codes or have provided read access to their repos. This runs using a Github action and auto refreshes once every week. 

* Find the most updated user: app [JSON here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samapriya/ee-appshot/main/app_urls.json)

* Find the most updates source code to user: app [zip here](https://github.com/samapriya/ee-appshot/raw/main/ee-appshot.zip)

* Think of this as a snapshot of a subset of apps with the latest urls for these apps available in the [JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samapriya/ee-appshot/main/app_urls.json)

* This also includes source code for all the apps to which it gets the url links for (**not all app will run outside app environment owing to how apps might have been permissioned**)

* Extract and find the JS source code to these apps which you can open in any text editor
